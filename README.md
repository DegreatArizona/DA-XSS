# DA-XSS
The script iterates over a list of common XSS payloads, injecting each payload into the specified parameters of the target URL. It then makes a request to the URL and checks if the payload is reflected in the response. If a potential XSS vulnerability is found, the script outputs the details, including the parameter and payload used.
